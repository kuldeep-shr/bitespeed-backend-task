<h1>⚡ FluxKart Identity Resolver</h1>

  <p><em>"When this baby hits 88 miles per hour... you're gonna see some serious contact merging!"</em> – Dr. Emmett Brown</p>

<p>Welcome, time-traveling devs! This is the early-stage boot-up of the <strong>FluxKart Identity Resolver</strong> — our attempt to untangle the identity of a certain brilliant but secretive scientist (yes, <strong>Doc Brown</strong>), who keeps making purchases with different emails and phone numbers. 🕵️‍♂️</p>

<p><strong>FluxKart</strong> is integrating with <strong>Bitespeed</strong> to make sure we recognize our loyal (and occasionally interdimensional) customers — no matter how many disguises they use across the timeline.</p>

<h2>🧪 Project Status</h2>
<p><strong>🚧 Project initialized.</strong> Folder structure, dependencies, and time machine skeleton are ready. API logic coming soon...</p>

<hr>

<h2>📦 Installation</h2>

<pre>
<code>git clone https://github.com/fluxkart/bitespeed-identity-resolver.git
cd bitespeed-identity-resolver
yarn install
yarn dev
</code>
</pre>

<p>Make sure you have <code>Node.js</code> and <code>Yarn</code> installed. Then spin this baby up like it’s 1955!</p>

<h2>🛠 Tech Stack (Planned)</h2>

<ul>
  <li>🧠 <strong>Node.js</strong> + <strong>Express</strong> – our server's flux capacitor</li>
  <li>🗂️ <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> / <strong>SQLite</strong> – to store Doc’s contact puzzle pieces</li>
  <li>🧪 <strong>Jest</strong> – to make sure our code doesn’t break the space-time continuum</li>
  <li>⚙️ <strong>Yarn</strong> – because package management should be fast (like 88 mph fast)</li>
</ul>

<h2>👨‍🔬 A Word from the Doc</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"Marty! If you're reading this README, you're in the right timeline. Now let's unify those contact records before it's too late!"</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>More code coming soon. Until then, keep your circuits warm, your code clean, and your customers identified — even if they’re from the future.</p>

<p><strong>Great Scott!</strong> Let's do this.</p>
